# StatesGame
Used pandas and turtle to replicate the sporcle states game. https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states
Every single time you type in the name of the state. That state get labelled on the map and you score a point.
The goal is to name as many states as possible.
Once you've added a state and it actually exists it gets added to the map.
A new csv file is then generated of the missed states.
